This is a bot for the [AmpMod Wiki](https://ultiblocks.miraheze.org).

Currently it clears the sandbox if it has not been edited by a human for more than 4 hours. Additionally, if you post "/remindme" anywhere on a talk page, the bot will immediately post a message on your user talk page. Eventually, you will be able to set a time to remind, and possibly have it reply directly.

It is run by 50-scratch-tabs (GitHub) or 50_scratch_tabs (AmpMod Wiki and Scratch)

The bot's user documentation will be housed on the AmpMod Wiki, and the developer/contributing documentation can be found [here](https://ampmod.js.org/AmpBot).
